### How to build it yourself:

You can build the dll yourself. Open the RBRTestPlugin.sln with Visual Studio 2022 and compile it. You must have a directory in C: called "C:\Games\Richard Burns Rally Original\Plugins\". There you will find the compiled dll wich will be called RBRTestPlugin.dll, rename it and you are ready to go.
